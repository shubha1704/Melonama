## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
  It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential
  to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
 - Goal : Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
 - Dataset : CNN_assignment.zip

## Conclusions
- Model 1 is  Overfitting so data is augumented to improve the model performance
- After augumentation model performance not improved ,so the imbalnced dataset has to be balanced using Augumentation by increasing the class count by 500.
- After balancing data model is stable Val- accuracy is 88.20
- By increasing the epocs accuracy can be improved further
